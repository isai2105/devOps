Run with:

"ansible-playbook ansible_playbook_sample.yml"
OR
"ansible-playbook ansible_playbook_sample.yml -i inventory" if adding the custom inventory is desired.

To run the playbook and include the definitions of that particular inventory
The inventory has custom hosts, variables, etc...

This allows us to divide the configuration into environments, for example:
inventory_prod
inventory_qa
inventory_local

Also, there can be several inventories added.
This means, we could have an inventory with sensible variables or custom variables with personal information 

Run with: --tags "firstTestTag" to only run the task: "Sample with loop and accessing / creating variables", which is the only one tagged with that tag.
